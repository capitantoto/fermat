  abstract = {A new prior is proposed for learning representations of high-level concepts of the kind we manipulate with language. This prior can be combined with other priors in order to help disentangling abstract factors from each other. It is inspired by cognitive neuroscience theories of consciousness, seen as a bottleneck through which just a few elements, after having been selected by attention from a broader pool, are then broadcast and condition further processing, both in perception and decision-making. The set of recently selected elements one becomes aware of is seen as forming a low-dimensional conscious state. This conscious state is combining the few concepts constituting a conscious thought, i.e., what one is immediately conscious of at a particular moment. We claim that this architectural and information-processing constraint corresponds to assumptions about the joint distribution between high-level concepts. To the extent that these assumptions are generally true (and the form of natural language seems consistent with them), they can form a useful prior for representation learning. A low-dimensional thought or conscious state is analogous to a sentence: it involves only a few variables and yet can make a statement with very high probability of being true. This is consistent with a joint distribution (over high-level concepts) which has the form of a sparse factor graph, i.e., where the dependencies captured by each factor of the factor graph involve only very few variables while creating a strong dip in the overall energy function. Instead of making predictions in the sensory (e.g. pixel) space, one can thus make predictions in this high-level abstract space, which do not have to be limited to just the next time step but can relate events far away from each other in time. The consciousness prior also makes it natural to map conscious states to natural language utterances or to express classical AI knowledge in a form similar to facts and rules, albeit capturing uncertainty as well as efficient search mechanisms implemented by attention mechanisms.},

  abstract = {We present a series of theoretical arguments supporting the claim that a large class of modern learning algorithms that rely solely on the smoothness prior  with similarity between examples expressed with a local kernel  are sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, or more precisely to the variability of the target. Our discussion covers supervised, semisupervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. These algorithms are found to be local in the sense that crucial properties of the learned function at x depend mostly on the neighbors of x in the training set. This makes them sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, well studied for classical non-parametric statistical learning. We show in the case of the Gaussian kernel that when the function to be learned has many variations, these algorithms require a number of training examples proportional to the number of variations, which could be large even though there may exist short descriptions of the target function, i.e. their Kolmogorov complexity may be low. This suggests that there exist non-local learning algorithms that at least have the potential to learn about such structured but apparently complex functions (because locally they have many variations), while not using very specific prior domain knowledge.},

However, the shortest path distance is highly sensitive to the addition of corrupted edges in the graph, either through noise or an adversarial perturbation. In this paper we study a family of Hamilton-Jacobi equations on graphs that we call the p-eikonal equation. We show that the p-eikonal equation with p = 1 is a provably robust distance-type function on a graph, and the p {$\rightarrow$} {$\infty$} limit recovers shortest path distances. While the p-eikonal equation does not correspond to a shortest-path graph distance, we nonetheless show that the continuum limit of the p-eikonal equation on a random geometric graph recovers a geodesic density weighted distance in the continuum. We consider applications of the p-eikonal equation to data depth and semi-supervised learning, and use the continuum limit to prove asymptotic consistency results for both applications. Finally, we show the results of experiments with data depth and semi-supervised learning on real image datasets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10, which show that the p-eikonal equation offers significantly better results compared to shortest path distances.},

  abstract = {Important information concerning a multivariate data set, such as clusters and modal regions, is contained in the derivatives of the probability density function. Despite this importance, nonparametric estimation of higher order derivatives of the density functions have received only relatively scant attention. Kernel estimators of density functions are widely used as they exhibit excellent theoretical and practical properties, though their generalization to density derivatives has progressed more slowly due to the mathematical intractabilities encountered in the crucial problem of bandwidth (or smoothing parameter) selection. This paper presents the first fully automatic, data-based bandwidth selectors for multivariate kernel density derivative estimators. This is achieved by synthesizing recent advances in matrix analytic theory which allow mathematically and computationally tractable representations of higher order derivatives of multivariate vector valued functions. The theoretical asymptotic properties as well as the finite sample behaviour of the proposed selectors are studied. In addition, we explore in detail the applications of the new data-driven methods for two other statistical problems: clustering and bump hunting. The introduced techniques are combined with the mean shift algorithm to develop novel automatic, nonparametric clustering procedures which are shown to outperform mixture-model cluster analysis and other recent nonparametric approaches in practice. Furthermore, the advantage of the use of smoothing parameters designed for density derivative estimation for feature significance analysis for bump hunting is illustrated with a real data example.},

In this paper, we give the first exact algorithm for computing a data-sensitive metric called the nearest neighbor metric. In fact, we prove the surprising result that a previously published 3-approximation is an exact algorithm. The nearest neighbor metric can be viewed as a special case of a density-based distance used in machine learning, or it can be seen as an example of a manifold metric. Previous computational research on such metrics despaired of computing exact distances on account of the apparent difficulty of minimizing over all continuous paths between a pair of points. We leverage the exact computation of the nearest neighbor metric to compute sparse spanners and persistent homology. We also explore the behavior of the metric built from point sets drawn from an underlying distribution and consider the more general case of inputs that are finite collections of path-connected compact sets. The main results connect several classical theories such as the conformal change of Riemannian metrics, the theory of positive definite functions of Schoenberg, and screw function theory of Schoenberg and Von Neumann. We also develop some novel proof techniques based on the combination of screw functions and Lipschitz extensions that may be of independent interest.},

In particular, previous studies of cross-validation (CV) methods have been restricted to biased and unbiased CV selection of diagonal bandwidth matrices. However, for certain types of target density the use of full (i.e. unconstrained) bandwidth matrices offers the potential for significantly improved density estimation. In this paper, we generalize earlier work from diagonal to full bandwidth matrices, and develop a smooth cross-validation (SCV) methodology for multivariate data. We consider optimization of the SCV technique with respect to a pilot bandwidth matrix. All the CV methods are studied using asymptotic analysis, simulation experiments and real data analysis. The results suggest that SCV for full bandwidth matrices is the most reliable of the CV methods. We also observe that experience from the univariate setting can sometimes be a misleading guide for understanding bandwidth selection in the multivariate case.},

The paper develops a form of theory which appears to be appropriate to measurements of position on a sphere. The primary problems of estimation as applied to the true direction, and the precision of observations, are discussed in the subcases which arise. The simultaneous distribution of the amplitude and direction of the vector sum of a number of random unit vectors of given precision, is demonstrated. From this is derived the test of significance appropriate to a worker whose knowledge of precision lies entirely in the internal evidence of the sample. This is the analogue of `Student's' test in the Gaussian theory of errors. The general formulae obtained are illustrated using measurements of the direction of remanent magnetization in the directly and inversely magnetized lava flows obtained in Iceland by Mr J. Hospers.},

  abstract = {Starting from a neurobiological standpoint, I will propose that our capacity to understand others as intentional agents, far from being exclusively dependent upon mentalistic/linguistic abilities, be deeply grounded in the relational nature of our interactions with the world. According to this hypothesis, an implicit, prereflexive form of understanding of other individuals is based on the strong sense of identity binding us to them. We share with our conspecifics a multiplicity of states that include actions, sensations and emotions. A new conceptual tool able to capture the richness of the experiences we share with others will be introduced: the shared manifold of intersubjectivity. I will posit that it is through this shared manifold that it is possible for us to recognize other human beings as similar to us. It is just because of this shared manifold that intersubjective communication and ascription of intentionality become possible. It will be argued that the same neural structures that are involved in processing and controlling executed actions, felt sensations and emotions are also active when the same actions, sensations and emotions are to be detected in others. It therefore appears that a whole range of different `mirror matching mechanisms' may be present in our brain. This matching mechanism, constituted by mirror neurons originally discovered and described in the domain of action, could well be a basic organizational feature of our brain, enabling our rich and diversified intersubjective experiences. This perspective is in a position to offer a global approach to the understanding of the vulnerability to major psychoses such as schizophrenia.},

Performance evaluations using training data from mixture Gaussian and mixture Cauchy densities are presented. The results show that the curse of dimensionality and the sensitivity of control parameters have a much more adverse impact on the kernel density estimators than on the projection pursuit density estimators.},

This paper aims to present a coherent view of the theory of the topic by relating these developments to the following key ideas: exponential families, transformation models, 'tangent-normal' decompositions, transformations to multivariate problems and the central limit theorem. Further unification is attained by identifying three basic approaches to directional statistics, in which the basic sample space, the sphere, is regarded respectively as a subset of Euclidean space, an object in its own right and as something approximated by a tangent plane. Parametric, nonparametric and informal methods are considered. The discussion is mainly of observations on the circle or sphere but a section on non-spherical sample spaces is included. /// De nombreux articles sur la th{\'e}orie et la pratique de la statistique directionnelle ont paru depuis la revue du sujet par Mardia (1975a).

The principal discovery is that in a simple network of adaptive physical elements which receives signals from a primary event space, the signal representations are automatically mapped onto a set of output responses in such a way that the responses acquire the same topological order as that of the primary events. In other words, a principle has been discovered which facilitates the automatic formation of topologically correct maps of features of observable events. The basic self-organizing system is a one- or twodimensional array of processing units resembling a network of threshold-logic units, and characterized by short-range lateral feedback between neighbouring units. Several types of computer simulations are used to demonstrate the ordering process as well as the conditions under which it fails.},

  journal = {Wikipedia},
  urldate = {2023-03-03},
  abstract = {Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), normal discriminant analysis (NDA), or discriminant function analysis is a generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant, a method used in statistics and other fields, to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. The resulting combination may be used as a linear classifier, or, more commonly, for dimensionality reduction before later classification. LDA is closely related to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis, which also attempt to express one dependent variable as a linear combination of other features or measurements. However, ANOVA uses categorical independent variables and a continuous dependent variable, whereas discriminant analysis has continuous independent variables and a categorical dependent variable (i.e. the class label). Logistic regression and probit regression are more similar to LDA than ANOVA is, as they also explain a categorical variable by the values of continuous independent variables. These other methods are preferable in applications where it is not reasonable to assume that the independent variables are normally distributed, which is a fundamental assumption of the LDA method. LDA is also closely related to principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis in that they both look for linear combinations of variables which best explain the data. LDA explicitly attempts to model the difference between the classes of data. PCA, in contrast, does not take into account any difference in class, and factor analysis builds the feature combinations based on differences rather than similarities. Discriminant analysis is also different from factor analysis in that it is not an interdependence technique: a distinction between independent variables and dependent variables (also called criterion variables) must be made. LDA works when the measurements made on independent variables for each observation are continuous quantities. When dealing with categorical independent variables, the equivalent technique is discriminant correspondence analysis.Discriminant analysis is used when groups are known a priori (unlike in cluster analysis). Each case must have a score on one or more quantitative predictor measures, and a score on a group measure. In simple terms, discriminant function analysis is classification - the act of distributing things into groups, classes or categories of the same type.},

We believe this problem is rooted in the mismatch between existing statistical techniques and commonly encountered data; object representations are typically high dimensional but statistical techniques tend to treat high dimensions a degenerate case. To address this problem, we develop a dedicated statistical framework for machine learning in high dimensions. The framework derives from the observation that object relations form a natural hierarchy; this leads us to model objects as instances of a high dimensional, hierarchal generative processes. Using a distance based statistical technique, also developed in this paper, we show that in such generative processes, instances of each process in the hierarchy, are almost-always encapsulated by a distinctive-shell that excludes almost-all other instances. The result is shell theory, a statistical machine learning framework in which separability constraints (distinctive-shells) are formally derived from the assumed generative process.},

Comparisons are made with related data-driven metrics, which illustrate the broader role of density in kernel-based unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning. Computationally, we relate PWSPDs on complete weighted graphs to their analogues on weighted nearest neighbor graphs, providing high probability guarantees on their equivalence that are near-optimal. Connections with percolation theory are developed to establish estimates on the bias and variance of PWSPDs in the finite sample setting. The theoretical results are bolstered by illustrative experiments, demonstrating the versatility of PWSPDs for a wide range of data settings. Throughout the paper, our results generally require only that the underlying data is sampled from a compact low-dimensional manifold, and depend most crucially on the intrinsic dimension of this manifold, rather than its ambient dimension.},

These results depend heavily on the corresponding distributions for the isotropic random walk on hypersphere. Using these results we investigate some optimum properties of various important tests.

We exploit a novel algorithm for capturing manifold structure (high-order contractive auto-encoders) and we show how it builds a topological atlas of charts, each chart being characterized by the principal singular vectors of the Jacobian of a representation mapping. This representation learning algorithm can be stacked to yield a deep architecture, and we combine it with a domain knowledge-free version of the TangentProp algorithm to encourage the classifier to be insensitive to local directions changes along the manifold.

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs---30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10               6               optic nerve fibers---a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

It serves as a building block for many tasks in statistical inference, visualization, and machine learning. Density Estimation is widely adopted in the domain of unsupervised learning especially for the application of clustering. As big data become pervasive in almost every area of data sciences, analyzing high-dimensional data that have many features and variables appears to be a major focus in both academia and industry. Highdimensional data pose challenges not only from the theoretical aspects of statistical inference, but also from the algorithmic/computational considerations of machine learning and data analytics. This paper reviews a collection of selected nonparametric density estimation algorithms for high-dimensional data, some of them are recently published and provide interesting mathematical insights. The important application domain of nonparametric density estimation, such as modal clustering, are also included in this paper. Several research directions related to density estimation and high-dimensional data analysis are suggested by the authors.},

For superior clustering analysis results, a number of distance measures have been proposed. Recently, geodesic distance has been widely applied to clustering algorithms for nonlinear groupings. However, geodesic distance is sensitive to noise and hence, geodesic distance-based clustering may fail to discover nonlinear clusters in the region of the noise. In this study, we propose a density-based geodesic distance that can identify clusters in nonlinear and noisy situations. Experiments on various simulation and benchmark datasets are conducted to examine the properties of the proposed geodesic distance and to compare its performance with that of existing distance measures. The experimental results confirm that a clustering algorithm with the proposed distance measure demonstrated superior performance compared to the competitors; this was especially true when the cluster structures in the data were inherently noisy and nonlinearly patterned.},
